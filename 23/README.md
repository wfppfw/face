## Deployments

Canvas Portfolio is designed to simplify the deployment process on various platforms, whether serverless or not. Below are several detailed methods to deploy your portfolio.

### 1. Serverless Platforms (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

When using serverless platforms, it's important to note that Nuxt Content v3 relies by default on SQLite for content storage. Since these platforms do not support SQLite natively, we recommend connecting Canvas Portfolio to an external database such as:

-  **PostgreSQL**
-  **Turso**
-  **D1**

For further details on this process and the suitable solutions for serverless deployments, refer to the official Nuxt Content documentation:  
[Nuxt Content and Serverless Deployment](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/deploy/serverless)

#### Vercel deployment do not need any extra configuration.

### 3. Deployment via Docker

Canvas Portfolio is also available as a Docker image, making it easy to deploy in containerized environments. An official Docker image is automatically created using a GitHub workflow whenever a new release is made, or it can be triggered manually. 

This workflow not only builds the official Canvas image but also provides a standard way for anyone who forks the project to create their own Docker image with a proper version tag (e.g., v2.0, v1.0.0, etc.).

**To pull the latest Docker image:**

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/hugorcd/canvas:latest
```

You can also use Docker Compose for a quick deployment. A community-provided [docker-compose.community.yml](docker-compose.community.yml) file is available and can be used with platforms like Coolify for one-click deployments.
